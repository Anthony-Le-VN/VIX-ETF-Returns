# 📊 Market Sentiment and ETF Returns  
**ECON 467 – Advanced Econometrics Final Project**

**Author:** Anthony Le  
**Date:** December 2025  

## Overview

This repository contains the full replication package for my ECON 467 final project:

> **“How does market sentiment, proxied by the VIX, affect the returns of major ETFs representing different equity market segments?”**

Using weekly data from **December 2004 to November 2025**, this project studies how changes in the VIX influence returns across nine major ETFs representing broad market, style, sectoral, and international equity segments. The analysis employs fixed-effects panel regressions and ETF-specific models to document **heterogeneity and asymmetry** in volatility sensitivity.

All tables, figures, and empirical results in the final paper are fully reproducible from the code in this repository.

## Key Findings

- A one-standard-deviation increase in VIX reduces average ETF weekly returns by **~1.36 percentage points**
- Volatility sensitivity varies substantially across market segments  
  - **Financials (XLF)** and **small caps (IWM)** are the most sensitive  
  - **Value stocks (VTV)** are the least sensitive
- Volatility effects are **asymmetric**  
  - “Good volatility” during market rallies is significantly less harmful than volatility during downturns

## Repository Structure

At the top level, the project includes the finalized paper in PDF format, which presents the research question, methodology, and findings, along with documentation files that describe the structure and usage of the repository.
- All data-related materials are contained in the Data/ directory, which is divided into clearly defined stages of the empirical workflow.
- The empirical workflow is driven by Stata scripts located in the Command_Files/ directory.

Together, this structure follows best practices for reproducible empirical research by clearly separating raw data, processed data, code, outputs, and documentation.

## Data Description

- **ETFs (9):** SPY, QQQ, IWM, VUG, VTV, EFA, EEM, XLF, XLK  
- **Sentiment Proxy:** CBOE Volatility Index (VIX)  
- **Market Controls:**  
  - S&P 500 returns  
  - Term spread (10Y – 3M Treasury)  
  - Credit spread (Moody’s Baa – Aaa)  
- **Frequency:** Weekly  
- **Observations:** 9 ETFs × ~1,140 weeks = 10,260 ETF-week observations  

Data were sourced from **Bloomberg Terminal** and processed in Stata.

## Replication Instructions

### Software Requirements

- **Stata BE, Version 18**
- Stata package: `outreg2`

### Steps to Replicate

1. **Set working directory**
   ```stata
   cd "path/to/Le-Project"
   ```

2. **Run data processing**
   ```stata
   do Command_Files/Processing&Construction.do
   ```

   This script:
   - Imports Bloomberg data  
   - Constructs weekly ETF log returns  
   - Constructs S&P 500 weekly returns  
   - Creates the VIX–SPX interaction term  
   - Constructs term and credit spreads  
   - Reshapes ETF price data from wide to long format  
   - Saves the final analysis dataset as `Data/Analysis_Data/analysis.dta`

3. **Run empirical analysis**
   ```stata
   do Command_Files/Analysis.do
   ```

   This script:
   - Loads `analysis.dta`
   - Produces summary statistics
   - Generates descriptive visualizations
   - Estimates fixed-effects panel regressions
   - Estimates ETF-specific regressions
   - Exports regression tables and figures to:
     - `Data/Regression_Output/`
     - `Data/Visualization/`

---

## Expected Output

Successful replication will reproduce:

- `analysis.dta`
- Summary statistics tables
- Regression output files
- All figures reported in the paper
- Stata log files documenting execution

---

## Notes

- All tables and figures in the final paper are generated **entirely** from `Analysis.do`
- Log files are included to ensure full transparency and reproducibility
- The repository is organized to follow best practices for empirical replication
